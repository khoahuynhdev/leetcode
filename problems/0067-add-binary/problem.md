# 0067. Add Binary

Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return _their sum as a binary string_.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** a = "11", b = "1"
    **Output:** "100"
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** a = "1010", b = "1011"
    **Output:** "10101"
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104`
  * `a` and `b` consist only of `'0'` or `'1'` characters.
  * Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.
