# 1758. Minimum Changes To Make Alternating Binary String

You are given a string `s` consisting only of the characters `'0'` and `'1'`. In one operation, you can change any `'0'` to `'1'` or vice versa.

The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the string `"010"` is alternating, while the string `"0100"` is not.

Return _the**minimum** number of operations needed to make_ `s` _alternating_.

 

**Example 1:**
    
    
    **Input:** s = "0100"
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** If you change the last character to '1', s will be "0101", which is alternating.
    

**Example 2:**
    
    
    **Input:** s = "10"
    **Output:** 0
    **Explanation:** s is already alternating.
    

**Example 3:**
    
    
    **Input:** s = "1111"
    **Output:** 2
    **Explanation:** You need two operations to reach "0101" or "1010".
    

 

**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 104`
  * `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
